## Stephen Fletcher
#### Junior Developer

[Projects](#projects) |

I recently completed [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) and have 20 years experience in hardware development and design. 

I decided to switch from hardware design and development into software so I can explore the endless possibilities available. My 20 years working in x-ray hardware covering design, development, test, manufacturing, and customer support leave me with many skills highly relevent to software development. 

## Projects

These projects demonstrate a range of technologies used when developing applications in small teams at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/).

## Work Experience

**Nikon Metrology** (2017 to 2021)  
_System Testing and Integration Lead_ 

* Technical lead responsible for the development of an ambitious and complex high Voltage x-ray source
* Set the technical direction for a multidisciplinary team to ensure the large number of separately developed hardware subcomponents interacted safely and performed well upon integration
* Designed and implemented systems testing regime and proportionate risk assessment, redundancy and controls

**X-Tek Systems Ltd** (1997 to 2017)  
_Senior Technical Development roles_

* Range of technical leadership roles in bleeding edge x-ray hardware developemnt
* Responsible for every step of the development process:
  - Conceptual design
  - Validating business and customer needs
  - Test design, build, test and iterate
  - Install and configuration on-site
  - Debugging of new and legacy components
* Extensive customer support experience - inperson as well as remote 1st, 2nd and 3rd line technical support for products
* VBA scripts to customise control of x-ray hardware
* Created Microsoft Excel Macros to meet business needs
* 2D Engineering drawings using Draftsight

## Skills

#### Iterative design / Test Driven Development
I have extensive experience with x-ray hardware iterative design and test driven developent. I used this experience to dramatically improve the reliability and performance of an x-ray source with a cycle of tests and design interations.

* Existing x-ray source performance did not meet customer expectations for performance and durabiliity
* Defined expectations and designed tests to measure performance against expectations
* Conducted tests and iteratively modified design when tests were failed
* Released a product design that passed tests and met expectations

#### System Interaction Troubleshooting
I have a strong capability to break down seemingly complex system issues into manageable steps to understand and analyse the underlying problems.

I diagnosed a subtle output stability issue with a high voltage x-ray power supply:
* X-ray voltage would violently oscillate under some conditions
* All subcomponents performed as expected and passed tests
* I devised a series of system tests to determine the origin of the oscillation
* Further tests varying system parameters to fully understand the cause and nature of the oscillation

I discovered the x-ray high voltage stability was marginal by design. System variations and tolerances (e.g. attached capacitance) could cause unstable high voltage.

I explained this in detail to an analogue electronics expert, enabling them to redesign the voltage feedback loop. The redesigned circuit produced stable output even with extreme system variations.

## Education
