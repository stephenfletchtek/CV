I am an independent problem solver who learns at pace by getting involved and doing. The trickier the problem, the more motivated I am to get it solved! 

I recently completed [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) and have more than 20 years experience in hardware development and design. 

Switching from hardware to software means I can develop with more flexibility than hardware allows. My time working in x-ray hardware covered design, development, test, manufacturing, and customer support, leaving me with many skills highly relevent to software development. 

## Projects

These projects demonstrate a range of technologies used when developing applications in small teams at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/).

## Skills

#### Test Driven Development and Testing

At Makers I used Test Driven Development (TDD) with `RSpec` (Ruby) and `Jest` (Javascript) as a tool to develop robust elegant code. I used TDD to test expected behaviour and edge cases.

With x-ray hardware development I freqently designed and ran tests to prove performance or drive design change. In one case I dramatically improved the reliability and performance of an x-ray source with a cycle of tests and design interations.

* Existing x-ray source performance did not meet customer expectations for performance and durabiliity
* Defined expectations and designed tests to measure performance against expectations
* Conducted tests and iteratively modified design when tests were failed
* Released a product design that passed tests and met expectations

#### System Interaction Troubleshooting
I have a strong capability to break down seemingly complex system issues into manageable steps to understand and analyse the underlying problems.

At Makers I used a range of debugging methods such as **change debugging** and **discovery debugging** using tools such as `binding.irb` and `p` in Ruby and node and `console.log` in Javascript.

In hardware, I diagnosed a subtle output stability issue with a high voltage x-ray power supply:
* X-ray voltage would violently oscillate under some conditions
* All subcomponents performed as expected and passed tests
* I devised a series of system tests to determine the origin of the oscillation
* Further tests varying system parameters to fully understand the cause and nature of the oscillation

I discovered the x-ray high voltage stability was marginal by design. System variations and tolerances (e.g. attached capacitance) could cause unstable high voltage.

I explained this in detail to an analogue electronics expert, enabling them to redesign the voltage feedback loop. The redesigned circuit produced stable output even with extreme system variations.

## Experience

#### Makers Academy (June 2022 to October 2022)

At Makers I practiced paired programming on a daily basis, using Test Driven Development to create a range of web applications. Our projects were regularly committed to github for both individual and group projects. Throughout the bootcamp I became proficient in Ruby, and Javascript whilst improving my debugging skills, and agile process.

Specific tech and skills I covered at Makers:
- git branches, pull requests, merge, merge conflicts, rebase 
- Ruby, Javascript (ES6)
- Object Oriented Programmming
- Sinatra, Express
- TDD and Agile development
- Rspec, Jest, Cypress
- Rubocop, ESlint
- PostgreSql, Mongodb,
- Phaser

**Nikon Metrology** (2017 to 2021)  
_System Testing and Integration Lead_ 

* Technical lead responsible for the development of an ambitious and complex high Voltage x-ray source
* Set the technical direction for a multidisciplinary team to ensure the large number of separately developed hardware subcomponents interacted safely and performed well upon integration
* Designed and implemented systems testing regime and proportionate risk assessment, redundancy and controls

**X-Tek Systems Ltd** (1997 to 2017)  
_Senior Technical Development roles_

* Range of technical leadership roles in bleeding edge x-ray hardware developemnt
* Responsible for every step of the development process:
  - Conceptual design
  - Validating business and customer needs
  - Test design, build, test and iterate
  - Install and configuration on-site
  - Debugging of new and legacy components
* Extensive customer support experience - inperson as well as remote 1st, 2nd and 3rd line technical support for products
* VBA scripts to customise control of x-ray hardware
* Created Microsoft Excel Macros to meet business needs
* 2D Engineering drawings using Draftsight
