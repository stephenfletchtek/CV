💻 After more than 20 years in x-ray hardware development - where I was troubleshooter-in-chief for a large high-tech engineering firm - I decided to change career and follow my love of problem-solving into the world of software engineering . Over the years I've built many transferable skills: in product design and development, customer service, faultfinding and diagnosis, team-working, coaching, management and leadership.

🌱 Nonetheless I clearly entered the software engineering space with knowledge and skill gaps - so I have been working assiduously to address them: I’ve learned a wide range of languages and frameworks; I’ve worked solo, in pairs, and as part of an agile team; I’ve practiced working with APIs and OAuth 2.0 for one of my personal [home automation projects](https://github.com/stephenfletchtek/heattolight); and I’ve grown my understanding of common web security risks (e.g. OWASP Top 10).

## Skills

#### Collaboration

At Makers Bootcamp I had to build applications both in small teams and using paired programming. I took the time to get to know my team and pairing partner and to understand their knowledge, skills and preferred ways of working and communicating. This meant I could make sure we were working to our strengths, meeting each other's needs, and organising the work optimally. As a result of this collaboration, my work was much higher quality than any of us could have produced individually. The intensity of the collaboration is evidenced in my GitHub repos.

#### Testing

At Nikon Metrology, one of our products was consistently failing to meet customer expectations for reliability or performance - and was damaging our corporate reputation. I was tasked to rectify the situation by bringing about design improvements. I designed a systematic programme of tests - first to identify and understand the problems, and second, to develop and iterate necessary design improvements. Using this prototype, test, improve cycle, I worked with colleagues to release an improved product that passed tests, met customer expectations, and began to rebuild our reputation for reliable, quality products.

At Makers, I was asked to write a command-line app that modelled a bank account, with deposits, withdrawals, and bank statements, by taking a Test Driven Development approach. I designed tests based on requirements, then created the minimum code needed to pass each test - resulting in an efficiently developed and robust application that behaved as expected, including edge cases.

#### Troubleshooting
I have a strong capability to break down seemingly complex system issues into manageable steps to understand and analyse the underlying problems.

At Makers I used a range of debugging methods such as **change debugging** and **discovery debugging** using tools such as `binding.irb` and `p` in Ruby and node and `console.log` in Javascript.

In hardware, I diagnosed a subtle output stability issue with a high voltage x-ray power supply:
* X-ray voltage would violently oscillate under some conditions
* All subcomponents performed as expected and passed tests
* I devised a series of system tests to determine the origin of the oscillation
* Further tests varying system parameters to fully understand the cause and nature of the oscillation

I discovered the x-ray high voltage stability was marginal by design. System variations and tolerances (e.g. attached capacitance) could cause unstable high voltage.

I explained this in detail to an analogue electronics expert, enabling them to redesign the voltage feedback loop. The redesigned circuit produced stable output even with extreme system variations.

## Education

#### University of Bristol (1994 to 1997)
* BSc Chemical Physics
