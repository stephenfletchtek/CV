üíª After more than 20 years in x-ray hardware development - where I was troubleshooter-in-chief for a large high-tech engineering firm - I decided to change career and follow my love of problem-solving into the world of software engineering . Over the years I've built many transferable skills: in product design and development, customer service, fault finding and diagnosis, team-working, coaching, management and leadership.

üå± Nonetheless I clearly entered the software engineering space with knowledge and skill gaps - so I have been working assiduously to address them: I‚Äôve learned a wide range of languages and frameworks; I‚Äôve worked solo, in pairs, and as part of an agile team; I‚Äôve practised working with APIs and OAuth 2.0 for one of my personal [home automation projects](https://github.com/stephenfletchtek/heattolight); and I‚Äôve grown my understanding of common web security risks (e.g. OWASP Top 10).

## Skills

#### Collaboration

At Makers I had to build applications both in small teams and using paired programming. I took the time to get to know my team and pairing partner and to understand their knowledge, skills and preferred ways of working and communicating. This meant I could make sure we were working to our strengths, meeting each other's needs, and organising the work optimally. As a result of this collaboration, my work was much higher quality than any of us could have produced individually. The intensity of the collaboration is evidenced in my GitHub repos.

When leading the team developing a novel x-ray source at Nikon Metrology I needed to solve problems that crossed over different disciplines. I formed a good working relationship with electronics designers, mechanical designers, and our engineering workshop enabling me to openly discuss ideas and challenge team member's assumptions. The impact of this collaboration was buy-in from all stakeholders and a fast turnover of prototypes.

#### Testing

I wrote a tech-test style command-line app that modelled a bank account, with deposits, withdrawals, and bank statements, following a Test Driven Development approach. I designed tests based on requirements, then created the minimum code needed to pass each test - resulting in an efficiently developed, readable, and robust application that behaved as expected, including edge cases.

At Nikon Metrology, one of our products was consistently failing to meet customer expectations for reliability or performance - and was damaging our corporate reputation. I was tasked to rectify the situation by bringing about design improvements. I designed a systematic programme of tests - first to identify and understand the problems, and second, to develop and iterate necessary design improvements. Using this prototype, test, improve cycle, I worked with colleagues to release an improved product that passed tests, met customer expectations, and began to rebuild our reputation for reliable, quality products.

#### Troubleshooting
I have a strong capability to break down seemingly complex system issues into manageable steps to understand and analyse the underlying problems.

During my final project at Makers, the game my team was developing ran too slowly on mobile devices. I needed to work out why it ran so slow even though it was just fine on a laptop. One by one I disabled different components of the game (change debugging) - e.g. obstacles, scrolling 3D-effect background, and gravity to uncover which of these had the greatest impact on the slow running of the game. I discovered the scrolling background had by far the most impact on slow running and discussed this with the team member who had implemented the background. They solved the slow running issue by presenting a simplified background for mobile devices.

In hardware, I diagnosed a subtle output stability issue with a high voltage x-ray power supply:
* X-ray voltage would violently oscillate under some conditions
* All subcomponents performed as expected and passed tests
* I devised a series of system tests to determine the origin of the oscillation
* Further tests varying system parameters to fully understand the cause and nature of the oscillation

I discovered the x-ray high voltage stability was marginal by design. System variations and tolerances (e.g. attached capacitance) could cause unstable high voltage.

I explained this in detail to an analogue electronics expert, enabling them to redesign the voltage feedback loop. The redesigned circuit produced stable output even with extreme system variations.
