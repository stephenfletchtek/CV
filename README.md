I am an independent problem solver who learns quickly by getting involved and doing. The trickier the problem, the more motivated I am to get it solved! 

I recently completed [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) and have more than 20 years experience in hardware development and design. 

I changed to software so I can work with more flexibility than hardware allows. My time working in x-ray hardware covered design, development, test, manufacturing, and customer support, leaving me with many skills highly relevant to software development. 

## Projects

These projects demonstrate a range of technologies used whilst developing applications at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) bootcamp.

## Experience

#### Makers Academy (June 2022 to October 2022)

Makers Academy Bootcamp was a 12 week intensive course teaching core programming skills such as paired programming, test driven development and object oriented programming. The course required me to become proficient in Ruby and Javascript whilst creating web applications in small teams using agile development techniques. 

#### Team Treehouse and Codecademy (2021 - 2022)

Team Treehouse and Codecademy are online bootcamps where I learned Python, Django, and CSS whilst creating some solo projects. I also built some applications using OAuth 2.0 and deployed one of my projects on [python anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/). The projects are in my github repositories.

#### Nikon Metrology (2017 to 2021)  
_System Testing and Integration Lead_ 

* Technical lead responsible for the development of an ambitious and complex high Voltage x-ray source
* Set the technical direction for a multidisciplinary team to ensure the large number of separately developed hardware subcomponents interacted safely and performed well upon integration
* Designed and implemented systems testing regime and proportionate risk assessment, redundancy and controls

#### X-Tek Systems Ltd (1997 to 2017)  
_Senior Technical Development roles_

* Range of technical leadership roles in bleeding edge x-ray hardware development
* Responsible for every step of the development process:
  - Conceptual design
  - Validating business and customer needs
  - Test design, build, test and iterate
  - Install and configuration on-site
  - Debugging of new and legacy components
* Extensive customer support experience - in person as well as remote 1st, 2nd and 3rd line technical support for products
* VBA scripts to customise control of x-ray hardware
* Created Microsoft Excel Macros to meet business needs
* 2D Engineering drawings using Draftsight

## Skills

#### Collaboration

At Makers Bootcamp I had to build applications both in small teams and using paired programming. I took the time to get to know my team and pairing partner and to understand their knowledge, skills and preferred ways of working and communicating. This meant I could make sure we were working to our strengths, meeting each others needs, and organising the work optimally. As a result of this collaboration, my work was much higher quality than any of us could have produced individually. The intensity of the collaboration is evidenced in my GitHub repos.

#### Testing

At Nikon Metrology, one of our products was consistently failing to meet customer expectations for reliability or performance - and was damaging our corporate reputation. I was tasked to rectify the situation by bringing about design improvements. I designed a systematic programme of tests - first to identify and understand the problems, and second, to develop and iterate necessary design improvements. Using this prototype, test, improve cycle, I worked with colleagues to release an improved product that passed tests, met customer expectations, and began to rebuild our reputation for reliable, quality products.

At Makers, I was asked to write a command-line app that modelled a bank account, with deposits, withdrawals, and bank statements, by taking a Test Driven Development approach. I designed tests based on requirements, then created the minimum code needed to pass each test - resulting in an efficiently developed and robust application that behaved as expected, including edge cases.

#### Troubleshooting
I have a strong capability to break down seemingly complex system issues into manageable steps to understand and analyse the underlying problems.

At Makers I used a range of debugging methods such as **change debugging** and **discovery debugging** using tools such as `binding.irb` and `p` in Ruby and node and `console.log` in Javascript.

In hardware, I diagnosed a subtle output stability issue with a high voltage x-ray power supply:
* X-ray voltage would violently oscillate under some conditions
* All subcomponents performed as expected and passed tests
* I devised a series of system tests to determine the origin of the oscillation
* Further tests varying system parameters to fully understand the cause and nature of the oscillation

I discovered the x-ray high voltage stability was marginal by design. System variations and tolerances (e.g. attached capacitance) could cause unstable high voltage.

I explained this in detail to an analogue electronics expert, enabling them to redesign the voltage feedback loop. The redesigned circuit produced stable output even with extreme system variations.

## Education

#### University of Bristol (1994 to 1997)
* BSc Chemical Physics
