I am a back end software developer looking for my next challenge to further my programming capabiity and gain experience in testing, Test Driven Development and system architecture.

I have a degree in Chemical Physics from Bristol University and have spent 20 years working in x-ray hardware covering design, development, test, manufacturing, and customer support. Since leaving my job I have learned Python and Django with some HTML & CSS and have now turned my attention to the Makers Academy software bootcamp.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP

#### Your University / College (start_date to end_date)

- Subject, any specialisms
- Grade
- Other cool stuff
